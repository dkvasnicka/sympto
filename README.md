SymptoMeter
======

[https://sympto-dk.rhcloud.com](https://sympto-dk.rhcloud.com) (Alpha-grade app right now)

This app will allow you or your partner to easily use the [symptothermal contraception method](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/symptothermal-method-22142.htm). It is a purely natural method that frees you from poisoning your (or partner's) body and the nature with hormonal pillsâ€¦ 

The app allows you to track daily temperature and automatically detects the correct [temperature rise](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/temperature-method-22143.htm).

**The app is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.**

The app is written using a pretty exotic mashup of technologies (self-study FTW!): embedded native XML database BaseX running inside of a Java EE 6 app and serving REST endpoints written in XQuery (RESTXQ). There is a bit of Clojure on the server side as well and the client side is written using JavaScript, AngularJS and ClojureScript.

Never tested in Internet Explorer.
